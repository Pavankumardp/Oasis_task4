# Email spam detection with machine learning
Context:
Classifying emails into distinct labels can have a great impact on customer support. By using machine learning to label emails the system can set up queues containing emails of a specific category. This enables support personnel to handle request quicker and more easily by selecting a queue that match their expertise.
Objectives:
This study aims to improve the manually defined rule based algorithm, currently implemented at a large telecom company, by using machine learning. The proposed model should have higher F1-score and classification rate. Integrating or migrating from a manually defined rule based model to a machine learning model should also reduce the administrative and maintenance work. It should also make the model more flexible
